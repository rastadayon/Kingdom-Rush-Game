## Run
In order to run this game you need to execute make. After the executable file (test.out) is created run it with the name of the file containing the enemy wave information. The afformentioned files are in the a.txt and b.txt for level 1 and level 2 respectively.


## RSDL
In this project I have used RSDL graphical library which is a wrapper for SDL 2
